An art exhibition inspired by natural intelligence

With disruptive news of artificial intelligence and neural networks coming out every day, I can't help but wondering how it would affect the art world? Just as the rise of net art in 1990s, there are already artists creating artworks through AI or inspired by it. What does it do to curation? Well we did see a pioneer here already:

What about natural intelligence -- our brain? 
The contemporary art realm has a wide range of media that artists could choose to employ, that appeal to our different sensory organs.
Then I got the idea of what about organizing an exhibition in the pattern of brain.
